## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **JavaScript**: Follow ES6+ standards, use modern syntax
- **CSS**: Follow BEM methodology, use CSS custom properties
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5, accessibility-first approach
- **Comments**: Write clear, helpful comments for complex logic

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Use efficient algorithms (Fisher-Yates shuffle is already optimized)
- Consider accessibility in all implementations

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera GX)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast support
- Touch-friendly interfaces (44px minimum touch targets)

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on multiple browsers
- Test on mobile devices
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers (if possible)
- Verify lottery algorithm fairness

### Automated Testing
Currently, the project doesn't have automated tests, but contributions to add testing would be welcome:
- Unit tests for lottery algorithms
- Integration tests for UI components
- Accessibility testing automation

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all functions
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README updates for new features
- Architecture decisions documented

### User Documentation
- Clear, step-by-step instructions
- Screenshots for visual features
- Examples for developers
- Beginner-friendly explanations
