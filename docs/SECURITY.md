# Security Policy - Lootjes Trekker

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 2.0.x   | ✅ Yes             | Current |
| 1.x.x   | ❌ No              | Legacy |

## Security Considerations

### Application Security
The Lootjes Trekker application is designed with security in mind:

#### Client-Side Security
- **No Server-Side Processing**: All lottery operations run client-side
- **No Data Transmission**: No sensitive data is sent to external servers
- **Local Storage Only**: Data stays in the user's browser
- **CSP Ready**: Content Security Policy compatible

#### Algorithm Security
- **Cryptographically Fair**: Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- **No Predictable Patterns**: Results are mathematically random
- **No External Dependencies**: Core algorithm has no external dependencies
- **Transparent Implementation**: Algorithm is open for verification

### Privacy Protection
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect user data
- **No Analytics**: No tracking or analytics code
- **No Cookies**: Application doesn't use cookies
- **Local Processing**: All operations happen locally in the browser

## Reporting a Vulnerability

###  Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

#### Immediate Action Required
For **critical security issues** (RCE, XSS, data exposure):
1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss publicly until fixed
3. **DO** email immediately: Davedevisser03@gmail.com or contact me at https://discord.gg/Q75YxgAmX4

#### What to Include
Please include in your security report:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing it
- **Your Details**: Name/handle for attribution (optional)

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Acknowledgment** | 24-48 hours | We confirm receipt of your report |
| **Initial Assessment** | 3-7 days | We assess severity and impact |
| **Investigation** | 1 weeks | We investigate and develop a fix |
| **Fix Development** | 1-3 weeks | We implement and test the solution |
| **Public Disclosure** | After fix | We publicly disclose (with credit) |

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Data breach potential

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Significant functionality bypass
- User data exposure

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited functionality issues
- Minor information disclosure
- Moderate impact vulnerabilities

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor security improvements
- Best practice violations
- Low-impact issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Keep Browser Updated**: Use latest browser versions
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Application requires JavaScript
- **Trust the Source**: Only use from official repository
- **Local Use**: Keep the application for local use only

### For Developers (Educational)
- **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape user-generated content
- **CSP Implementation**: Use Content Security Policy headers
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies

### For Self-Hosted Instances
If you're running your own instance (educational purposes only):
- **HTTPS Only**: Always serve over HTTPS
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your copy updated
- **Access Control**: Limit access if needed
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers

## Known Security Considerations

### Intentional Design Decisions
- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in the browser
- **No Authentication**: No user accounts or authentication system
- **No Persistence**: No server-side data storage
- **Public Code**: Source code is openly available (SCVL license)

### Potential Risks
- **Local Storage**: Data stored in browser local storage
- **Browser Security**: Relies on browser security model
- **Code Inspection**: Algorithm can be inspected/modified locally
- **No Audit Trail**: No server-side logging of lottery results

### Not Security Issues
The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:
- Users modifying local code (expected behavior)
- Browser console access to variables
- Client-side data manipulation
- Lack of server-side validation (by design)

## Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Security patch developed**
2. **Testing in isolated environment**
3. **Security advisory published**
4. **Updated version released**
5. **Users notified via GitHub**

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- GitHub Releases
- Repository README updates
- Email to reporters (if requested)

## Responsible Disclosure

### Our Commitment
- **Timely Response**: We respond to reports within 48 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We provide progress updates during investigation
- **Public Credit**: We credit reporters in security advisories (if desired)
- **No Legal Action**: We won't pursue legal action for responsible disclosure
